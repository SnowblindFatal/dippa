\section{Problem statement}
In house maintenance business, much of the technicians' working time is spent traveling to the customers and back to the company building. There is a good motivation to reduce the time spent traveling, because by itself it does not produce any value to the company, but rather generates only costs through wages, car usage and equipment reserved by the technician team. 

While planning the routes by manual work is feasible for small businesses, as a company scales up and the number of customers and technicians increases, automation becomes more and more important. At some point the overhead of implementing an automated system for the planning overcomes the cost of the ever increasing planning work. 

Once the factors affecting the work are known, it is possible to abstract the company's operation to numbers which in turn can be used as input parameters for algorithms.
