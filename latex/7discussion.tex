Based on my experiences with this project, I am certain that automating this kind of work planning would bring great benefit to a lot of companies. Though businesses are different and each has its own unique set of requirements, versatile libraries such as Jsprit could probably be used for their purposes.

There are so many various trades whose operation or parts of it can be abstracted to a VRP that there is much room for improvement in terms of automation in our society. It is no wonder that so much research has been done on the subject. 

The open source library Jsprit continues the good trend of increasing number of free tools being available to the general public. It is a good example how free software can be used to make the world more efficient. This will eventually and ultimately lead to humankind having more free time as workforce is replaced by machines. Assuming that this redistribution of work is taken into account on a political level, humankind can only benefit from this development.
